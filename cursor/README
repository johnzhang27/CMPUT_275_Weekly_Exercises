Weekly Exercise #1: Display and Joystick


Included Files:

	- joy_cursor.cpp: Contains the 4 functions: 
void setup(),
void redrawCursor(uint16_t colour),
void processJoystick(),
int main().

	- Makefile

	- README

Accessorise:
	* 1 Arduino Mega Board(AMG)
	* Breadboard
	* 7 wires
	* USB cable
	* joystick
	* touchscreen
	* A custome SD card provided by instructor

Wiring instructions: 
	Touchscreen connect with Arduino Mega Board(insert left side of the touchscreen from Pin 3.3V to
	Pin A5. Insert the right side of the touchscreen from Pin AREF to Pin RX0<-0.
	Arduino's Pin A8 <--> VRy of joystick.
	Arduino's Pin A9 <--> VRx of joystick.
	Arduino's Pin 5v <--> "+" on breadboard <--> +5V on joystick.
	Arduino's Pin GND <--> "-" on breadboard <--> GND on joystick.
	Arduino's Pin 53 <--> SW on joystick.
	Insert the SD card into touchscreen.


Running the code:
You should put joy_cursor.cpp into a file that contains 
- Makefile
- lcd_image.cpp
- lcd_image.h
1. Connect Arduino Mega Boards and other necessary parts of this exercise.

2. Go to the terminal and type "make", then "make upload" to upload the made file to Arduino Mega Board.
Then play with the joystick and check display of serial monitor.

Notes and Assumptions:
	joy_cursor.cpp: Contains the 4 functions:

setup() doesn't have argument and return nothing(None).

void redrawCursor(uint16_t colour) will redraw a cursor with the colour you want. Its argument is the colour.

void processJoystick() will help to move the cursor on Edmonton map without leaving a trace behind. It will also determine whether the cursor is moving or not. The function has no argument and retuen nothing.

main() is needed to excute other functions.
