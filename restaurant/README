Weekly Exercise #2: Restaurants and Pointer


Included Files:

	- get_restaurant.cpp: Contains the 8 functions:
struct restaurant(more like assignning memory for variables), 
void setup(),
void getRestaurant(int restIndex, restaurant* restPtr),
void getRestaurantFast(int restIndex, restaurant* restPtr),
int processTOUCHSCREEN(),
void SLOWwriteonTOUCHSCREEN(uint32_t time_slow2, uint32_t A_slow),
void FASTwriteonTOUCHSCREEN(uint32_t time_fast2, uint32_t A_fast),
int main().

	- Makefile

	- README

Accessorise:
	* 1 Arduino Mega Board(AMG)
	* USB cable
	* touchscreen
	* A custome SD card provided by instructor

Wiring instructions: 
	Touchscreen connect with Arduino Mega Board(insert left side of the touchscreen from Pin 3.3V to
	Pin A5. Insert the right side of the touchscreen from Pin AREF to Pin RX0<-0.

	Insert the SD card into touchscreen.


Running the code:
You should put get_restaurant.cpp into a file that contains 
- Makefile
1. Connect Arduino Mega Boards and other necessary parts of this exercise.

2. Go to the terminal and type "make", then "make upload" to upload the made file to Arduino Mega Board.
Then touch the SLOW and FAST buttons and check display.

Notes and Assumptions:
	get_restaurant.cpp: Contains the 8 functions:

struct restaurant is more like assignning space for variables.

setup() doesn't have argument and return nothing(None).

void getRestaurant(int restIndex, restaurant* restPtr) well get all 1066 restaurants by a slow way.

void getRestaurantFast(int restIndex, restaurant* restPtr) will get all 1066 restaurants without getting a block each time. The function will check if the block number is same as previous one then decide to get a new block or not.

int processTOUCHSCREEN(),
void SLOWwriteonTOUCHSCREEN(uint32_t time_slow2, uint32_t A_slow),
and void FASTwriteonTOUCHSCREEN(uint32_t time_fast2, uint32_t A_fast) will help to change the display on tft.

main() is needed to excute other functions.
