Weekly Exercise #3: Pseudocode to Code


Included Files:

	- flipflop.cpp: Contains 2 functions:
void flipFlopSort(uint32_t a[], int m, int startlocation),
int main().
	-textmatch.cpp: Contains 2 functions:
void textMatch(const char *s, const char *t),
int main().
	- Makefile

	- README

Accessorise:
	None.

Wiring instructions: 
	None.


Running the code:
You should put flipflop.cpp and textmatch.cpp into a file that contains 
- Makefile(specific makefile made for this exercise.)
1. Go to the terminal and type "make" to make 2 excutable files for both flipflop and textmatch.
2. Or you could type "make flipflop" or "make textmatch" to make excutable file each of them.
3. Type "make flipflop.o" or "make textmatch.o" could make the .o files which is the intermedian file for the excutable file.
4. You could type "make clean" to delete all excutable files.

Notes and Assumptions:
	flipflop.cpp: Contains 2 functions:
	1. void flipFlopSort(uint32_t a[], int m, int startlocation) is for the sorting algorithm.
	2. main() is needed to excute other functions.
	textmatch.cpp: Also contains 2 functions:
	1. textMatch(const char *s, const char *t) is from the pseudocode and is used to determine  	  	whether the 1st line of input apeared in the second line of input or not. Also cout the apeared
	index.
	2. main() is needed to excute other functions.
